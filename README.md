# Slamhound

    They sent a slamhound on Turner's trail in New Delhi, slotted it
    to his pheromones and the color of his hair. It caught up with him
    on a street called Chandni Chauk and came scrambling for his
    rented BMW through a forest of bare brown legs and pedicab
    tires. Its core was a kilogram of recrystallized hexogene and
    flaked TNT. He didn't see it coming. The last he saw of India was
    the pink stucco facade of a place called the Khush-Oil Hotel.

    Because he had a good agent, he had a good contract. Because he
    had a good contract, he was in Singapore an hour after the
    explosion. Most of him, anyway. The Dutch surgeon liked to joke
    about that, how an unspecified percentage of Turner hadn't made it
    out of Palam International on that first flight and had to spend
    the night there in a shed, in a support vat.

    It took the Dutchman and his team three months to put Turner
    together again. They cloned a square meter of skin for him, grew
    it on slabs of collagen and shark-cartilage polysaccharides. They
    bought eyes and genitals on the open market. The eyes were green.
